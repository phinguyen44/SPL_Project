## General Thoughts

**RESEARCH QUESTION**: What factors influence self-reported well-being in higher age populations?

**Model**: Logistic regression

**Why is this of interest**: Older Europeans are experiencing increased longevity, better health outcomes, and more personal freedom compared to generations prior; it is of interest to us to find the observable (and unobservable?) factors that influence their personal assessments of their own well-being, using self-reported survey data collected by SHARE (the Survey on Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe).

**Description of data**: Cross-sectional data from Wave 5 of the SHARE dataset.

## Open Items

1. Determine how we will handle missing values (data imputation). What assumptions of the missing values do we need to make? MAR? What distribution fits the variables?
2. What variables do we use in the model? How do we handle overfitting? Can we do some form of regularization or principal component analysis to reduce model complexity or even reduce the number of variables? What about stepwise regression?
3. Is our research question to broad? Should we try to focus on something more statistics-y?
